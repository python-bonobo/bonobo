"""
Execution strategies define how an actual job execution will happen. Default and recommended strategy is "threadpool",
for now, which leverage a :obj:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to run each node in a separate thread.

In the future, the two strategies that would really benefit bonobo are subprocess and dask/dask.distributed. Please be
at home if you want to give it a shot.
